# TrippAR (Stamford Hackathon project)

## Description

TrippAR is a cool new way to learn about a new area that you’re in. 

Simply point your phone’s camera at various landmarks and TrippAR will tell you about it!

TrippAR will also make suggestions about nearby landmarks and let you catch an Uber ride to them!
